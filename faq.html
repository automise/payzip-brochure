    <h4 id="signing-up" class="heading-4 faqs">Signing-up and using PayZip</h4>
    <div class="faq-question">What is PayZip and how do I sign up?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">PayZip is a club membership invoicing and payments system. It allows your members to pay by card whilst still allowing you to track cash, cheque and bank payments.<br>‍<br>It’s free to sign up and use the basic features, which includes sending invoices to your members and recording cash, cheque and bank transfer payments against those invoices.<br>‍<br>By upgrading to our Pro plan, your members will be able to make their payments using a debit or credit card. Money collected is paid weekly to your nominated bank account (less PayZip service fees). Your dashboard is automatically updated with payments made online, so you’re always up-to-date.<br>‍<br>To get started, <a href="https://app.payzip.co.uk/User/Register" target="_blank">click here</a>. Enter your full name, a valid email address and a password. You will also need to confirm you have read our <a href="https://payzip.co.uk/terms-conditions.html" target="_blank">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>. You will need to verify your email address before continuing. Once you have created your club, you will be able to start adding your members and sending invoices to them.</div>
    <div class="faq-question">Who can use PayZip?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">At the moment, PayZip is only for UK based not-for-profit clubs, and you must be at least 18 years to sign up your club. It doesn’t matter what your club does, we have lots of different sports clubs and community groups using PayZip to manage member payments.</div>
    <div class="faq-question">Does my club have to pay to use PayZip?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">Registration is free and there are no ongoing monthly fees. You can add as many members and send as many invoices as you like. The regular plan will always be free, however if you want to enable online payments you will need to upgrade to the Pro plan (fees apply). Upgrading is straightforward and allows us to carry out anti money laundering checks to approve you.</div>
    <h4 id="requesting-money" class="heading-4 faqs">Requesting Money</h4>
    <div class="faq-question">What information is required to take online payments?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">We need to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who upgrades their club to accept card payments. These are standard anti money laundering checks. We require the following information to consider your club for online payments:</div>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>full name</li>
      <li>correspondence address</li>
      <li>date of birth</li>
      <li>legal sex</li>
      <li>contact telephone number</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="faq-answer">These details will be used by one of our team who will perform anti-money laundering checks to verify your identity. If we need further information, we will contact you.</div>
    <div class="faq-question">What other information do you need?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">You are required to confirm the correct name for your organisation and enter the bank details where you would like the deposits to be made. All bank details are encrypted and making changes to these will require written notification once set.<br>‍<br>Once we have this information we will review your application and notify you as soon as you have been accepted on the Pro plan so you can start taking online payments. During this period you will still be able to record cash, cheque and bank transfer payments.</div>
    <h4 id="club-members" class="heading-4 faqs">Club Members</h4>
    <div id="payzippenarth" class="faq-question">What is &quot;PAYZIP PENARTH&quot; and why is it on my card statement?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">PayZip is a club membership invoicing and payments system. If you see <span class="text-span">PAYZIP PENARTH</span> on your credit card or bank statement, it means you’ve recently paid an invoice emailed to you from a club using PayZip to collect their membership fees. If you have any concerns about a transaction, please get in touch with us by emailing  <span class="email-address">help@payzip.co.uk</span> and we’ll be happy to provide further details.</div>
    <div class="faq-question">Do I need to create an account with PayZip to pay my club?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">No - but if you do, you&#x27;ll get your own dashboard showing you the payments you&#x27;ve made. You can create an account at any time and see your past payments too. This only applies to direct PayZip clubs, so if you&#x27;re a UK Athletics athlete, your payments are managed by the Secretaries&#x27; Portal software and creating a PayZip account to see these payments won&#x27;t work for you at the moment - we&#x27;re looking into how we can provide this for you.</div>
    <div class="faq-question">I have a query with my payment - who should I speak to?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">In the first instance, speak with your club&#x27;s membership secretary or treasurer. If they need the matter investigated further, they can contact us at <span class="email-address">help@payzip.co.uk</span> and we&#x27;ll do our best to help.</div>
    <h4 id="pricing" class="heading-4 faqs">Pricing</h4>
    <div class="faq-question">Is there a fee for using PayZip?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">There are no setup costs, minimum subscription terms or a set monthly cost to the club.  PayZip charges a small fee only when an invoice is paid online.  The fee consists of two parts:<br><br><strong>Service Fee</strong> – This enables us to provide you with rock-solid reliability, comprehensive reporting tools to ensure you get your money as quickly as possible from your members, and a complete tracking solution to help you keep tabs on all your slow and non-payers.<br><br><strong>Transaction Fee</strong> – This is a fixed cost set by Barclaycard, our card services provider.<br><br>We do not charge a fee if your members pay the club by cash, cheque or direct into its bank account via BACS - though you will have to manually record these payments in PayZip.<br><br>Fees that we collect allow us to run the PayZip system, to ensure that we achieve our goal of helping you get more money, more quickly from your members. <br><br><strong>Please note</strong>: in line with the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) legislation, your members are never charged anything extra for paying online by card - PayZip’s fees are deducted from the monies the club receives.</div>
    <div class="faq-question">What are PayZip&#x27;s fees?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">When your members pay online, PayZip charges 5% + £0.35 per transaction. There are no sign-up fees, no minimum use period, no monthly fees and no hidden extras. We do not apply a charge if a member chooses to pay the club via a manual method (cash, cheque, BACS), though you have to record this payment yourself. Card payments are recorded automatically.<br><br><strong>Please note:</strong> in line with the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) legislation, your members are never charged anything extra for paying online by card - PayZip&#x27;s fees are deducted from the monies the club receives.<br></div>
    <div id="wheresmymoney" class="faq-question">When will I receive payments from my club&#x27;s members?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">We pay the club once a week on a Wednesday for all payments up to and including the previous Wednesday. We also send a remittance email to the secretary&#x27;s email address, which shows the full breakdown of the money being paid to the club.<span class="text-span email-address"></span></div>
    <div class="faq-question">How do I know the money is safe?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">All PayZip online transactions are securely captured and processed by Barclaycard. All transactions will be protected using their built-in fraud checking system, and Internet Authentication services, such as <em>Verified by Visa</em> &amp; <em>MasterCard SecureCode</em>, giving you complete peace of mind.<br><br>We will shortly be updating PayZip to work with the new Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) practices required for online payments. More information on SCA is available from Barclaycard is available <a href="https://www.barclaycard.co.uk/business/news-and-insights/guide-to-strong-customer-authentication" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>
    <div class="faq-question">I have a question that isn&#x27;t answered here.</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">No problem, just get in touch with us at <span class="email-address">help@payzip.co.uk</span> and we&#x27;ll be happy to help.</div>
