      <h1 class="legal legalh1">Privacy Policy</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="legal legalbody">PayZip knows that you care how information about you is used and shared and we appreciate your trust in us to do that carefully and sensibly.  This notice describes the privacy policy of PayZip.  By visiting PayZip, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</div>
    <h3 class="legal legalh3">What Personal Information About Members Does PayZip Gather?</h3>
    <div class="legal legalbody">The information we learn from members helps us personalise and continually improve your experience at PayZip.  We use the information to process payments, communicate with you about payments and organisations that you are a member of, or have indicated you are interested in, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content and recommend organisations and services that might be of interest to you.  We also use this information to improve our site and service, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.<br><br>Here are the types of information we gather.</div>
    <ol class="legal">
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item"><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> we receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way.  You can choose not to provide certain information but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.  We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customising the service for you, improving our service, and communicating with you.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item"><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.  For example, like many websites, we use &quot;cookies&quot; and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses PayZip.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item"><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="legal legalh3">What About Cookies?</h3>
    <ol class="legal">
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer&#x27;s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser and to provide features such as personalised content and storage of items in your shopping basket.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item">The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.  Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on&#x27;s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.  However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of PayZip&#x27;s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.  For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your basket, proceed to checkout, or use any PayZip products and services that require you to sign in.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item">If you do leave cookies turned on, be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="legal legalh3">Does PayZip share the Information it receives?</h3>
    <div class="legal legalbody">Information about members is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others.  PayZip shares customer information only as described below:</div>
    <ol class="legal">
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item"><strong>Organisations:</strong> If you have indicated that you are a member of an organisation, or have an interest in that organisation, we will share your personal details (Name, Address and email address only) with that organisation.  If you make a payment to an organisation, we will also share details of what you have paid for with the organisation.  We will not share other information we hold about you (for example information on other organisations that you are a member of or interested in) with an organisation unless you consent to us doing so.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item"><strong>Your Payment Details:</strong> We will never disclose your card or bank account details to any party, other than to our payment service provider for the purposes of processing your payment.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item"><strong>Third Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, for example processing credit card payments and providing marketing services.  They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.  Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the UK&#x27;s Data Protection Act.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item"><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses.  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).  Also, if PayZip or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item"><strong>Protection of PayZip and Others:</strong> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of PayZip, our users or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.  Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from members for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item"><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="legal legalh3">How Secure Is Information About Me?</h3>
    <ol class="legal">
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item">We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item">We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming a payment.  Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during payment processing.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item">We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information.  Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</li>
      <li class="bulleted legal list-item">It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer.  Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="legal legalh3">What Information Can I Access?</h3>
    <div class="legal legalbody">PayZip gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with PayZip for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.</div>
    <h3 class="legal legalh3">Notices &amp; Revisions</h3>
    <div class="legal legalbody">If you have any concern about privacy at PayZip, please contact us and we will try to resolve the issue for you.<br><br>Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Notice will change also.  We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our website frequently to see recent changes.  Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</div>
